## üîÑ Application Workflow

The application provides a complete journey for both guests and hosts:

1.  **Sign Up & Login**: A user first creates an account or logs in. The system uses sessions to maintain user authentication state.
2.  **Create a Listing**: Once logged in, a user can "Become a Host" and create a new property listing, providing details like title, description, price, location, and images.
3.  **Book a Stay**: Other users can browse or search for this listing and book it for a selected date range.
4.  **Leave a Review**: After a stay, the user can leave a rating and a comment on the listing's page.
5.  **Manage Bookings**: Users can view all their trips in the "My Bookings" section and have the option to cancel them.
